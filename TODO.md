# Node
- (X) population
  - (D) bigint
- (X) step
  - (C) test
- (X) get/set
  - (C) test
- (X) macrocell
  - (C) test
- (A) reduce
  - (C) test
- (B) hide Block, instead expose 2d bitvec
  - doc and test
  - copy from rect, paste to pos
  - depth aware full bitvec
- (C) normalize node
  - document how fns treat depth
  - should almost never need to be called, serves as a place to document assumptions
- (D) runtime config to tune caches
- (D) hide depth, instead just use width_log2 renamed as size
  - is easier to think about externally and helps prepare api for non-two-state cells
# GUI
- (X) image
- (X) drag screen
- (X) zoom screen in and out
- (A) grid lines
- (A) play/pause and speed control
  - display generation number, population, and speed
  - space to advance once (the base speed, which may not be 1 generation)
  - entry to play/pause
  - numpad + to increase speed (default doubles)
  - numpad - to decrease speed
    - expressed as b*2^n
- (A) click screen to set/clear cell
  - display cursor position
