# Node
- (X) population
  - (D) bigint
- (X) step
  - (C) test
- (X) get/set
  - (C) test
- (X) macrocell
  - (C) test
- (X) reduce
  - (C) test
- (X) offset
  - (C) test
- (A) rotate and flip
  - (C) test
- (A) clip rect, clear rect
  - (C) test
- (C) normalize node
  - document how fns treat depth
  - should almost never need to be called, serves as a place to document assumptions
- (C) runtime config to tune caches
  - build a cache module to generalize how/what metrics are collected (hits, misses, generations)
  - evaluate alternative cache crates, possibly just getting API design right
- (D) hide depth, instead just use width_log2 renamed as size
  - is easier to think about externally and helps prepare api for non-two-state cells
- (D) hide Block, instead expose 2d bitvec
  - doc and test
  - copy from rect, paste to pos
  - depth aware full bitvec
  - no longer as necessary, this was primarilly alternative to directly offset and paste modes
  - which turned out to not actually improve the API as much as I initially expected
- (D) evaluate need to use a bigint library, are any optimized for relatively small ints? I doubt I'd get much past 100 bits, but would rather not pay for u128 everywhere
# GUI
- (X) image
- (X) drag screen
- (X) zoom screen in and out
- (A) grid lines
- (X) play/pause and speed control
  - display generation number, population, and speed
  - space to advance once (the base speed, which may not be 1 generation)
  - entry to play/pause
  - numpad + to increase speed (default doubles)
  - numpad - to decrease speed
    - expressed as b*2^n
- (X) display cursor position
- (A) cursor controls
  - select (click and drag left mouse)
    - Ctrl-C to put into clipboard
    - Ctrl-D to clear
    - Ctrl-X to clipboard and clear
  - paste (Ctrl-V to enter)
    - R to rotate CW (Shift-R for CCW)
    - F to flip horizontal (Shift-F for vertical)
    - Esc to leave
    - (X) click to paste
    - Ctrl-click to paste with xor
  - draw (E to enter)
    - (X) click to flip
    - Esc to leave
